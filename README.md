# Solving-RED-with-Weighted-Proximal-Methods----WMP-Solver
Implement the WMP solver for the RED problem. See details of this algorithm from our paper: T. Hong, I. Yavneh, and M. Zibulevsky, ''[Solving RED with Weighted Proximal Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13052v2)''. 

In order to run this file, you need additional files. See the codes in our previous paper ''[Acceleration of RED via Vector-Extrapolation](https://github.com/happyhongt/Acceleration-of-RED-via-Vector-Extrapolation)''. The easy way to use this function is to save this function in the ''minimizers'' file once you download the codes in our previous paper and then use it as other algorithms for RED. 

If you find any bug or troubles to run this file, please shot an email to Tao Hong: hongtao@cs.technion.ac.il.
